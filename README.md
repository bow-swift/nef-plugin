üí° Generates [__Markdown__](#-generates-markdown-file-from-playground) files from Xcode Playground.

### üìÉ Generates markdown file from Playground

Xcode Playgrounds let you write comments in markdown format using the symbols //: for single line comments, or /*: */ for multiline comments. Markup for playgrounds includes page level formatting for headings and other elements, formatting spans of characters, showing inline images, and several other features. You can read more in the [Markup Formatting Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/index.html).

You can create a markdown file from playground page with the nef action `Editor > nef > Export Playground page to markdown`

&nbsp;

### üì≤ Create a Playground Book from your Swift package

You can create a Playground compatible with you iPad from a Swift package. You only need to open the swift package in Xcode,
and select the action `Editor > nef > Playground Book from Swift Package`

It will ask you where to save the Playground Book, and it will start to build it.

</p>

> This feature needs to use Swift Package Manager tool. Consequently, it will need to disable the sandbox thus it is not allowed in the App Store; but if you want to enjoy this feature, you only need to install the `.dmg` you'll find in the [releases](https://github.com/bow-swift/nef-plugin/releases) section.

&nbsp;

## üî® Xcode navigation keyboard shortcuts

To make you a more productive developer, you can associate a keyboard shortcut to each `nef` action.
Open the shortcuts menu in `Xcode > Preferences... > Key Bindings` and set your command.
