This project provides an extension for Xcode to integrate some nef features directly in the IDE. Using the core of `nef`, you can [export snippets](https://github.com/bow-swift/nef#-exporting-carbon-code-snippets) from your code selection directly in Xcode.

&nbsp;

## üì• Installation

You can install `nef` plugin from [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/nef/id1479391704?mt=8) or download the last binary from the [releases](https://github.com/bow-swift/nef-plugin/releases) section.

To complete the installation, you should enable `nef` extension from `System Preferences > Extensions > Xcode Source Editor`

</p>

## üì≤ Create a Playground Book from your Swift package

You can create a Playground compatible with you iPad from a Swift package. You only need to open the swift package in Xcode,
and select the action `Editor > nef > Package ‚Üí Playground Book`

It will warn you where to save the Playground Book, and it will start to build it.

</p>

> This feature needs to use SwiftPM tool. Consequently, it will need to disable the sandbox thus it is not allowed in the App Store; but if you want to enjoy this feature, you only need to install the `.dmg` you'll find in the [releases](https://github.com/bow-swift/nef-plugin/releases) section.

&nbsp;

## üåÅ Export code selection to image

In Xcode you can find the nef plugin options in `Editor`.

If you want to export your current code selection into a snippet, you only need to select the action `Editor > nef > Code selection ‚Üí Image`
